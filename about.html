                            <p>
                                Four years ago, I tackled a weather app project with basic features. At the time, it was
                                incredibly challenging, and I needed help from others to complete it. This experience
                                made me doubt my ability to succeed in tech. Now, after attending Holberton School, I've
                                decided to revisit and expand that project. By adding more advanced features and
                                improving its functionality, I'm proving to myself that I can achieve what once felt
                                impossible.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At Holberton, I gained a deeper understanding of backend, frontend, and DevOps concepts.
                                I'm now required to submit this project at the end of the foundation stage. With the
                                skills I've acquired, I'm able to code both the backend and frontend and deploy the web
                                app myself. This project showcases my growth and determination in software development.
                            </p>
